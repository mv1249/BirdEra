# BirdEra
here,i've made a deep learning model which can predict any specie of bird,just one has to upload the image of the bird and then the model will predict it
i've used the Convolution neural network with the concept of transfer learning,i've used the VGG16 model as the backend and flask and bootstarp as the front end..
i could'nt deploy it on heroku as the slug size exceeded 500Mb and the HDF5 file was nearly 100Mb,so could'nt make it..but i've added the notebooks of the model and the image selection
